# Frontend 404 Error Fix

## Problem
Your deployed frontend was getting 404 errors because Vite wasn't properly configured for production builds. The assets and bundled JavaScript couldn't find the resources they needed.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `vite.config.js`
Added proper build configuration:
- `base: '/'` - Sets the base public path
- `outDir: 'dist'` - Specifies build output directory
- `assetsDir: 'assets'` - Organizes static assets
- Proper rollup options for chunking

### 2. Created `.env.production`
Ensures environment variables are correctly set during production build:
- `VITE_API_URL=https://gamehubjijiplease.onrender.com`
- `VITE_SOCKET_SERVER_URL=https://gamehubjijiplease.onrender.com`

## How to Rebuild and Redeploy

### Step 1: Clean Previous Build
```bash
cd /home/jiji/Desktop/gamehub/frontend
rm -rf dist
```

### Step 2: Rebuild the Frontend
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a fresh `dist` folder with properly configured assets.

### Step 3: Verify the Build
Check that these files exist:
```bash
ls -la dist/
```

You should see:
- `index.html`
- `assets/` folder with JS and CSS files
- `vite.svg` and other public assets

### Step 4: Redeploy to Your Hosting Service

**If using Render, Vercel, or Netlify:**
1. Push your changes to Git:
   ```bash
   cd /home/jiji/Desktop/gamehub
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Configure Vite for production deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. Your hosting service should automatically rebuild and redeploy

**If manually deploying:**
1. Upload the entire `dist` folder to your hosting service
2. Make sure the web server serves `index.html` for all routes (SPA fallback)

### Step 5: Configure Your Hosting Service

Make sure your hosting service has these settings:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Publish Directory:**
```
dist
```

**Environment Variables (if not using .env.production):**
- `VITE_API_URL=https://gamehubjijiplease.onrender.com`
- `VITE_SOCKET_SERVER_URL=https://gamehubjijiplease.onrender.com`

**Rewrite Rules (for SPA routing):**
All routes should redirect to `index.html`

## Testing After Deployment

1. Open your deployed frontend URL
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab
3. Check for any remaining 404 errors
4. Test navigation between pages
5. Verify API calls are going to `https://gamehubjijiplease.onrender.com`

## Common Issues

### Still getting 404s?
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Check that environment variables are set in your hosting service
- Verify the build command ran successfully

### Assets not loading?
- Check that the `base` path in `vite.config.js` matches your deployment URL structure
- If deploying to a subdirectory (e.g., `example.com/app/`), change `base: '/'` to `base: '/app/'`

### API calls failing?
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure your backend allows requests from your frontend domain
